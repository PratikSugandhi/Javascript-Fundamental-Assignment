Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present
in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2,
multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first


const result = 3 + 5 * 2; // The result will be 13, not 16 (if addition had
higher precedence)

Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing accurate and efficient JavaScript code.
 By knowing the order in which operators are evaluated, developers can control the flow of calculations and ensure the desired results.
