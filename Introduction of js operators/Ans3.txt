There are many operators in JavaScript that let you carry out different operations.

These operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they require, and I'll be using examples to explain these categories in this tutorial.

The three categories of operators based on the number of operands they require are:

Unary operators: which require one operand (Un)
Binary operators: which require two operands (Bi)
Ternary operators: which require three operands (Ter)
Note that these categories do not only apply to JavaScript. They apply to programming in general.

*****
Unary Operator-
These operators require one operand for operation. Providing two or more can result in a syntax error.

1. unary plus.
1. unary minus.
3.pre and post increment
4.pre and psot decrement


*****Binary Operator-
These operators require two operands for operation. 
If one or more than two operands are provided, such operators result in a syntax error.
1. Arthimatic operator
2.assignement operator
3.Comparision operator.


*****Ternary Operator-
These operators require three operands.
 In JavaScript, there is one operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator.
