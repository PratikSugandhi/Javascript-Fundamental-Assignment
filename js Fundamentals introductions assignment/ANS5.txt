 Programming languages have a commenting feature that allows you to document your code and 
provide explanations in a way that humans can understand. When multiple developers collaborate on a 
codebase, comments are helpful for clarifying the purpose of specific code sections.


 In JavaScript, single line comments are created by using two forward slashes `//`. Anything after the two 
forward slashes will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter. This is useful when you want to add a comment 
to a single line of code.
 
A JS interpreter is a program that executes JavaScript code line by line, producing the desired output. It is 
essential for running JavaScript in different environments like web browsers or servers:

We can do single line comment by using double slash "//"


example code:
// This is a single-line comment
let age = 30; // This comment explains the variable's purpose

and for multi line coding we can use /*   */

example code:
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can provide detailed explanations for code blocks.
*/
function calculateArea(width, height) {
return width * height;
